##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

For base.css, I only included the general font for everything and the background color.

I had a hard time trying to decide what should go in layout.css vs modules.css. For layout.css, I ended up deciding to put what would carry over to every page of the site; the header, nav, and footer. I put the rest, which was mainly the parts relating to the blog post, in modules.css.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not refactor any existing CSS.
